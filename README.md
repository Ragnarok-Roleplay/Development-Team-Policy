## NDA Policy
> A Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) policy is a set of guidelines that outline how developers should handle sensitive and proprietary information. It’s crucial to protect Notorious's intellectual property, trade secrets, and other confidential data. An NDA policy helps ensure that developers understand their responsibilities and the potential consequences of disclosing sensitive information.
>   - Streaming
>     - You are allowed to stream your development process however there are restrictions to doing so. Those restrictions are listed below:
>       - Do not disclose any criminal locations

## Production Updates
> Update Schedule

<p align="right">(<a href="#meet-the-team">back to top</a>)</p>

## Training
> All senior members will be expected to help the new trial developers in your area. The new developers will be expected to ask questions and get used to how the development process is here at Notorious. If there are any specific questions please ask the lead developer or management.


<p align="right">(<a href="#meet-the-team">back to top</a>)</p>

## Senior Developers
> As a senior developer you are going to be handling a specific development team. There are going to be times where there will only be 1 senior member or there could be times where there are multiple. If you are a solo senior member you can make decisions on specific things related to that team. If there are questions or concerns with something related to your specific team you will be the first that will be reached out to. If there are multiple senior members in your specific development team they will be expected to work together and make decisions together. All senior members need to keep the Lead developer and management about incoming major or minor updates. All updates related to Tebex or patron will need to be approved by the lead developer or a member of management before the update is pushed live.


## Encryption
> There are some resource that we use that are encrypted
>   - Any files that have a .fxap file in them are CFX protected
>   - The CPT Framework is partially encrypted and compiled using Typescript
>   - If you are trying to host a private test server and need a key to start these resources please reach out to Capttech or a senior developer.

## Languages

## Team Channels
> As a development team we have 4 channels dedicated to those teams. These channels can be used to communicate with other member of your specific sub team.
>   - Script Development
>   - Vehicle Development
>   - Clothing Development
>   - Maps Development

> We also have some specific channels for all developers to utilize.
>   - Development Announcements
>     - Always keep this channel unmuted. All important information that the a developer in Notorious need to know about will be announced here. There will be some announcements that are time sensitive so always keep a eye out for any message posted here. You will be @ mentioned in this channel if its a time sensitive or important announcement.
>   - Dev Giveaways
>     - When a developer giveaway is done we will be using this chanel to post the giveaway in.
>   - Found Bugs / Exploits
>     - This channel is utilized by the staff members of the server to report and major game breaking bugs or exploits that are found or reported to them so only the developers and staff member know of the issue
>   - Created Embeds
>     - This channel is dedicated to embed generation. If a developer is trying to create a specific looking embed message they can utilize this channel for testing purposes. Ask Capttech for the details to the embed generator if you would like to use this.
>   - Development Errors
>     - This channel is used for any auto reported errors. Not all of our resources are currently using this system however the resources that are will report any error that is detected to this discord channel. You will know if the issue has been reported in the server if there is a message from the CPT framework saying that this error has been reported.
>   - Polyzones
>     - The use of polyzones in the server is very important. When you create a custom polyzone from in the server either in your personal discord or the man discord it will report all the details of the created polyzone in this channel.

<p align="right">(<a href="#meet-the-team">back to top</a>)</p>

## Bug Reports

**This is about all the information you as a developer need to know about handling bug reports**

> Reporting a exploit
>    - When a exploit or something that the entire community does not need to know about please report that in the ⁠found-bugs-exploits channel.

> Server Reported Errors
>    - We have a error tracker in the server that reports all client errors to the discord. These messages will be coming in the ⁠development-errors channel.

> Professionalism
>    - When you are handling a bug report be professional and handle yourself like you would like to be treated.
There are times where people report things that are not bug simply because they do not understand how to work the script.

> Tags
>    - When you take a bug report and want to work on the issue right click on the report and select the | In Progress | tag
When you complete the bug report and it took some kind of server side change tag the bug report with the tag | Fixed |
When there is a bug report that is something that they either didn't understand or something that did not take a server change to fix please put the | finished | tag

## Change Logs

***All members of the development team are welcome to post change logs. There are a few guide lines and procedures to follow while doing so. Those are all listed below.***

> Professionalism
>    - No offensive language
>    - Must be detailed out in a professional manner

> Detail
>    - We do not want to to much detail in our change logs. Put enough information as needed but do not overshare the information.
Ex: You updated the garage to now show who the vehicle was driven by last. The change would say something like, Updated garage system to share more information

> Version Number
>    - You will be expected to keep up the version number. The only number you should be increasing is the third number.
Ex: Version 3.5.1 would update to 3.5.2

> Format
>    - Change logs are posted in a embed message. You can generate these embeds using a online editor. The only required information is the current version, a section title and a small message under that title. Use the below resources to create your embed. If you are having issue or do not understand the software please ask Capttech for help.
